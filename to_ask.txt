[ WARN] [1746451262.738424176]: [image_transport] It looks like you are trying to subscribe directly to a transport-specific image topic '/camera1/image1/theora', in which case you will likely get a connection error. Try subscribing to the base topic '/camera1/image1' instead with parameter ~image_transport set to 'theora' (on the command line, _image_transport:=theora). See http://ros.org/wiki/image_transport for details.
